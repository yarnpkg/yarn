**Fast:** Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

**Reliable:** Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

**Secure:** Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

## Features

* Offline Mode: If you've installed a package before, you can install it again without any internet connection.
* Deterministic: The same dependencies will be installed the same exact way across every machine regardless of install order.
* Network Performance: Yarn efficiently queues up requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.
* Multiple Registries: Install any package from either npm or Bower and keep your package workflow the same.
* Network Resilience: A single request failing won't cause an install to fail. Requests are retried upon failure.
* Flat Mode: Resolve mismatching versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.
* More emojis. üêà
