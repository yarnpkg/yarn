Description: Package manager for the npm and bower package repositories
 Yarn is a package manager for the npm and bower registries with a few specific
 focuses.
 .
 Determinism: Based around a version lockfile which ensures that operations on
 the dependency graph can be easily transitioned. We check module directories
 and verify their integrity to ensure yarn install always produces the same file
 structure.
 .
 Security: Strict guarantees are placed around package installation. You have
 control over whether lifecycle scripts are executed for packages and package
 hashes are stored in the lockfile to ensure you get the same package each time.
 .
 Performance: We're always performing operations such as package resolving and
 fetching in parallel. This ensures little idle time and maximum resource
 utilization.
