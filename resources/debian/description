Package manager for the npm and bower package repositories
Yarn is a package manager for the npm and bower registries with a few specific
focuses.

Determinism: Based around a version lockfile which ensures that operations on
the dependency graph can be easily transitioned. We check module directories
and verify their integrity to ensure yarn install always produces the same file
structure.

Security: Strict guarantees are placed around package installation. You have
control over whether lifecycle scripts are executed for packages and package
hashes are stored in the lockfile to ensure you get the same package each time.

Performance: We are always performing operations such as package resolving and
fetching in parallel. This ensures little idle time and maximum resource
utilization.
