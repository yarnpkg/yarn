Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.
Yarn: Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

Fast: Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to again. It also
parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are
faster than ever.

Reliable: Using a detailed, but concise, lockfile format, and a deterministic
algorithm for installs, Yarn is able to guarantee that an install that worked
on one system will work exactly the same way on any other system.

Secure: Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package
before its code is executed.
