#Working with Version Control

To have people successfully develop or use your package, you need to ensure that all the necessary files are checked into your source control system.

##Required Files

The following files must be checked into source control for anyone to be able to manage your package:

    package.json: This has all the current dependencies for your package.
    yarn.lock: This stores the exact versions of each dependency for your package.
    The actual source code that provides the functionality for your package.

    Check out the Yarn Example Package for the minimum requirements necessary for a Yarn package.
