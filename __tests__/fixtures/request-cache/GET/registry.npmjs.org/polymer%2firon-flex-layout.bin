This component provides two different ways to use flexbox:\n\n1. [Layout classes](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/tree/master/classes). The layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules. Layout classes let you specify layout properties directly in markup.\n\n\n1. [Custom CSS mixins](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/blob/master/iron-flex-layout.html). The mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.\n\n\n\nA complete [guide](https://elements.polymer-project.org/guides/flex-layout) to `<iron-flex-layout>` is available.\n\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"polymer","email":"admin@polymer-project.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-02-03T00:24:48.802Z","created":"2016-02-02T04:43:19.489Z","0.0.1":"2016-02-02T04:43:19.489Z","0.0.3":"2016-02-03T00:24:48.802Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout#readme","keywords":["web-components","polymer","layout"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"The Polymer Authors"}],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/issues"},"license":"BSD-3-Clause","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
