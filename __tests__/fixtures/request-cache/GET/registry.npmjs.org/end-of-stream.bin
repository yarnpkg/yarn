end-of-stream\n\nA node module that calls a callback when a readable/writable/duplex stream has completed or failed.\n\n\tnpm install end-of-stream\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply pass a stream and a callback to the `eos`.\nBoth legacy streams and streams2 are supported.\n\n``` js\nvar eos = require('end-of-stream');\n\neos(readableStream, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has ended');\n});\n\neos(writableStream, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has finished');\n});\n\neos(duplexStream, function(err) {\n\tif (err) return console.log('stream had an error or closed early');\n\tconsole.log('stream has ended and finished');\n});\n\neos(duplexStream,
