react-timer-mixin\n\nUsing bare setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate and requestAnimationFrame calls\nis very dangerous because if you forget to cancel the request before the\ncomponent is unmounted, you risk the callback throwing an exception.\n\nIf you include TimerMixin, then you can replace your calls to\n`setTimeout(fn, 500)` with `this.setTimeout(fn, 500)` (just prepend `this.`) and\neverything will be properly cleaned up for you.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the module directly from npm:\n\n```\nnpm install react-timer-mixin\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar React = require('react');\nvar TimerMixin = require('react-timer-mixin');\n\nvar Component = React.createClass({\n  mixins: [TimerMixin],\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setTimeout(\n      () => { console.log('I do not leak!'); },\n      500\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"aweary","email":"Kierkegaurd@gmail.com"},{"name":"spicyj","email":"ben@benalpert.com"},{"name":"tadeuzagallo","email":"tadeuzagallo@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-08T20:22:49.319Z","created":"2015-03-20T17:26:02.460Z","0.13.0":"2015-03-20T17:26:02.460Z","0.13.1":"2015-03-23T23:36:48.112Z","0.13.2":"2015-07-03T21:27:49.312Z","0.13.3":"2015-09-09T22:35:09.862Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/reactjs/react-timer-mixin","keywords":["react","timer","mixin"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/reactjs/react-timer-mixin.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/reactjs/react-timer-mixin/issues"},"license":"BSD-3-Clause","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"mr.raindrop":true,"minchnew":true,"fsp1990":true,"zhenghua":true,"rockvic":true},"_attachments":{}}
