Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/ember-cli/ember-try/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ember-cli/ember-try/coverage)\n\nAn ember-cli addon to test against multiple bower and npm dependencies, such as `ember` and `ember-data`.\n\n### Installation\n\n```\nember install ember-try\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nThis addon provides a few commands:\n\n### `ember try:each`\n\nThis command will run `ember test` or the configured command with each scenario's specified in the config and exit appropriately.\n\nThis command is especially useful to use on CI to test against multiple `ember` versions.\n\nIn order to use an alternate config path or to group various scenarios together in a single `try:each` run, you can use\nthe `--config-path` option.\n\n```\n  ember try:each --config-path=\"config/legacy-scenarios.js\"\n```\n\nIf you need to know the scenario that is being ran (i.e. to customize a test output file name) you can use the `EMBER_TRY_CURRENT_SCENARIO`\nenvironment variable.\n\n#### `ember try:one <scenario> (...options) --- <command (Default: test)>`\n\nThis command will run any `ember-cli` command with the specified scenario. The command will default to `ember test`, if no command is specified on the command-line or in configuration.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n  ember try:one ember-1.11-with-ember-data-beta-16 --- ember test --reporter xunit\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n  ember try:one ember-1.11-with-ember-data-beta-16 --- ember serve\n```\n\nWhen running in a CI environment where changes are discarded you can skip resetting your environment back to its original state by specifying --skip-cleanup=true as an option to ember try.\n*Warning: If you use this option and, without cleaning up, build and deploy as the result of a passing test suite, it will build with the last set of dependencies ember try was run with.*\n\n```\n  ember try:one ember-1.11 --skip-cleanup=true --- ember test\n```\n\nIn order to use an alternate config path or to group various scenarios, you can use the `--config-path` option.\n\n```\n  ember try:one ember-1.13 --config-path=\"config/legacy-scenarios.js\"\n```\n\n#### `ember try:reset`\n\nThis command restores the original `bower.json` from `bower.json.ember-try`, `rm -rf`s `bower_components` and runs `bower install`. For use if any of the other commands fail to clean up after (they run this by default on completion).\n\n#### `ember try:ember <semver-string>`\n\nRuns `ember test` or the command in config for each version of Ember that is possible under the semver string given. Configuration follows the rules given under the `versionCompatibility` heading below.\n\n#### `ember try:config`\n\nDisplays the configuration that will be used. Also takes an optional `--config-path`.\n\n#### (DEPRECATED) ember try:testall\n\nThis command was renamed to `ember try:each` to better reflect what it does. This command still works, though.\n\n#### (DEPRECATED) `ember try <scenario> <command (Default: test)>`\n\nThis command is deprecated in favor of `ember try:one`. There are several bugs with passing options to the specified command that will not be fixed.\n\n\n### Config\n\n##### versionCompatibility\nIf you're using `ember-try` with an Ember addon, there is a short cut to test many Ember versions. In your `package.json` under the `ember-addon` key, add the following: \n\n```json\n  \"ember-addon\": {\n    \"versionCompatibility\": {\n       \"ember\": \">1.11.0 <=2.0.0\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThe value for \"ember\" can be any valid [semver statement](https://github.com/npm/node-semver).\nThis will autogenerate scenarios for each version of Ember that matches the statement. It will also include scenarios for `beta` and `canary` channels of Ember that will be allowed to fail. \nThese scenarios will ONLY be used if `scenarios` is NOT a key in the configuration file being used.\nIf `useVersionCompatibility` is set to `true` in the config file, the autogenerated scenarios will deep merge with any scenarios in the config file. For example, you could override just the `allowedToFail` property of the `ember-beta` scenario.\n\nTo keep this from getting out of hand, `ember-try` will limit the versions of Ember used to the lasted point release per minor version. For example, \">1.11.0 <=2.0.0\", would (as of writing) run with versions ['1.11.4', '1.12.2', '1.13.13', '2.0.0'].\n\n##### Configuration Files\n\nConfiguration will be read from a file in your ember app in `config/ember-try.js`. It should look like:\n\n```js\n/*jshint node:true*/\n\nmodule.exports = function() {\n  return {\n  /*\n    `command` - a single command that, if set, will be the default command used by `ember-try`.\n    P.S. The command doesn't need to be an `ember <something>` command, they can be anything.\n    Keep in mind that this config file is JavaScript, so you can code in here to determine the command.\n  */\n  command: 'ember test --reporter xunit',\n  /*\n    `bowerOptions` - options to be passed to `bower`.\n  */\n  bowerOptions: ['--allow-root=true'],\n  /*\n    `npmOptions` - options to be passed to `npm`.\n  */\n  npmOptions: ['--loglevel=silent', '--no-shrinkwrap=true'],\n  /*\n    If set to true, the `versionCompatibility` key under `ember-addon` in `package.json` will be used to\n    automatically generate scenarios that will deep merge with any in this configuration file.\n  */\n  useVersionCompatibility: true,\n  scenarios: [\n    {\n      name: 'Ember 1.10 with ember-data',\n\n      /*\n        `command` can also be overridden at the scenario level.\n      */\n      command: 'ember test --filter ember-1-10',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          'ember': '1.10.0',\n          'ember-data': '1.0.0-beta.15'\n        }\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Ember 1.11.0-beta.5',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          'ember': '1.11.0-beta.5'\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Ember canary with Ember-Data 2.3.0',\n      /*\n        `allowedToFail` - If true, if this scenario fails it will not fail the entire try command.\n      */\n      allowedToFail: true,\n      npm: {\n        devDependencies: {\n          'ember-data': '2.3.0'\n        }\n      },\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          'ember': 'components/ember#canary'\n        },\n        resolutions: {\n          'ember': 'canary'\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'Ember beta',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          'ember': 'components/ember#beta'\n        },\n        resolutions: { // Resolutions are only necessary when they do not match the version specified in `dependencies`\n          'ember': 'beta'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]};\n};\n```\n\nScenarios are sets of dependencies (`bower` and `npm` only). They can be specified exactly as in the `bower.json` or `package.json`\nThe `name` can be used to try just one scenario using the `ember try:one` command.\n\nIf no `config/ember-try.js` file is present, the default config will be used. This is the current default config:\n\n```js\n{\n  scenarios: [\n    {\n      name: 'default',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: { } /* No dependencies needed as the\n                             default is already specified in\n                             the consuming app's bower.json */\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'ember-release',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          ember: 'release'\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'ember-beta',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          ember: 'beta'\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'ember-canary',\n      bower: {\n        dependencies: {\n          ember: 'canary'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n### Video \n[![How to use EmberTry](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/559399937_500.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/157688157)\n\nSee an example of using `ember-try` for CI [here](https://github.com/kategengler/ember-feature-flags/commit/aaf0226975c76630c875cf6b923fdc23b025aa79), and the resulting build [output](https://travis-ci.org/kategengler/ember-feature-flags/builds/55597086).\n\n### Special Thanks\n\n- Much credit is due to [Edward Faulkner](https://github.com/ef4) The scripts in [liquid-fire](https://github.com/ef4/liquid-fire) that test against multiple ember versions were the inspriation for this project.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"katiegengler","email":"katie@kmg.io"},{"name":"rwjblue","email":"me@rwjblue.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-08-03T04:56:59.780Z","created":"2015-03-24T05:12:52.775Z","0.0.1":"2015-03-24T05:12:52.775Z","0.0.2":"2015-03-31T06:17:50.917Z","0.0.3":"2015-04-04T01:48:18.101Z","0.0.4":"2015-04-05T06:12:34.996Z","0.0.5":"2015-04-20T03:09:27.950Z","0.0.6":"2015-06-02T02:10:48.248Z","0.0.7":"2015-06-03T15:58:19.878Z","0.0.8":"2015-07-24T04:06:20.106Z","0.1.0":"2016-01-29T19:12:05.724Z","0.1.1":"2016-02-01T17:14:21.570Z","0.1.2":"2016-02-04T23:45:06.240Z","0.1.3":"2016-02-16T21:37:34.250Z","0.2.0":"2016-02-20T00:36:56.495Z","0.2.1":"2016-03-13T21:26:29.489Z","0.2.2":"2016-03-15T02:46:24.735Z","0.2.3":"2016-06-21T16:02:23.493Z","0.2.4":"2016-06-21T16:58:00.246Z","0.2.5":"2016-08-03T04:56:59.780Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try#readme","keywords":["ember-addon","testing"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try.git"},"author":{"name":"Katie Gengler"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-try/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"gregone":true,"bmeurant":true},"_attachments":{}}
