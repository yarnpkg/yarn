It is streams2 and operates purely using streams which means you can easily extract/parse tarballs without ever hitting the file system.\n\nNote that you still need to gunzip your data if you have a `.tar.gz`. We recommend using [gunzip-maybe](https://github.com/mafintosh/gunzip-maybe) in conjunction with this.\n\n```\nnpm install tar-stream\n```\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mafintosh/tar-stream.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mafintosh/tar-stream)\n\n## Usage\n\ntar-stream exposes two streams, [pack](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#packing) which creates tarballs and [extract](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#extracting) which extracts tarballs. To [modify an existing tarball](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream#modifying-existing-tarballs) use both.\n\n\nIt implementes USTAR with additional support for pax extended headers. It should be compatible with all popular tar distributions out there (gnutar, bsdtar etc)\n\n## Related\n\nIf you want to pack/unpack directories on the file system check out [tar-fs](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-fs) which provides file system bindings to this module.\n\n## Packing\n\nTo create a pack stream use `tar.pack()` and call `pack.entry(header, [callback])` to add tar entries.\n\n``` js\nvar tar = require('tar-stream')\nvar pack = tar.pack() // pack is a streams2 stream\n\n// add a file called my-test.txt with the content \"Hello World!\"\npack.entry({ name: 'my-test.txt' }, 'Hello World!')\n\n// add a file called my-stream-test.txt from a stream\nvar entry = pack.entry({ name: 'my-stream-test.txt', size: 11 }, function(err) {\n  // the stream was added\n  // no more entries\n  pack.finalize()\n})\n\nentry.write('hello')\nentry.write(' ')\nentry.write('world')\nentry.end()\n\n// pipe the pack stream somewhere\npack.pipe(process.stdout)\n```\n\n## Extracting\n\nTo extract a stream use `tar.extract()` and listen for `extract.on('entry', header, stream, callback)`\n\n``` js\nvar extract = tar.extract()\n\nextract.on('ent
11b8
ry', function(header, stream, callback) {\n  // header is the tar header\n  // stream is the content body (might be an empty stream)\n  // call next when you are done with this entry\n\n  stream.on('end', function() {\n    callback() // ready for next entry\n  })\n\n  stream.resume() // just auto drain the stream\n})\n\nextract.on('finish', function() {\n  // all entries read\n})\n\npack.pipe(extract)\n```\n\n## Headers\n\nThe header object using in `entry` should contain the following properties.\nMost of these values can be found by stat'ing a file.\n\n``` js\n{\n  name: 'path/to/this/entry.txt',\n  size: 1314,        // entry size. defaults to 0\n  mode: 0644,        // entry mode. defaults to to 0755 for dirs and 0644 otherwise\n  mtime: new Date(), // last modified date for entry. defaults to now.\n  type: 'file',      // type of entry. defaults to file. can be:\n                     // file | link | symlink | directory | block-device\n                     // character-device | fifo | contiguous-file\n  linkname: 'path',  // linked file name\n  uid: 0,            // uid of entry owner. defaults to 0\n  gid: 0,            // gid of entry owner. defaults to 0\n  uname: 'maf',      // uname of entry owner. defaults to null\n  gname: 'staff',    // gname of entry owner. defaults to null\n  devmajor: 0,       // device major version. defaults to 0\n  devminor: 0        // device minor version. defaults to 0\n}\n```\n\n## Modifying existing tarballs\n\nUsing tar-stream it is easy to rewrite paths / change modes etc in an existing tarball.\n\n``` js\nvar extract = tar.extract()\nvar pack = tar.pack()\nvar path = require('path')\n\nextract.on('entry', function(header, stream, callback) {\n  // let's prefix all names with 'tmp'\n  header.name = path.join('tmp', header.name)\n  // write the new entry to the pack stream\n  stream.pipe(pack.entry(header, callback))\n})\n\nextract.on('finish', function() {\n  // all entries done - lets finalize it\n  pack.finalize()\n})\n\n// pipe the old tarball to the extractor\noldTarballStream.pipe(extract)\n\n// pipe the new tarball the another stream\npack.pipe(newTarballStream)\n```\n\n## Performance\n\n[See tar-fs for a performance comparison with node-tar](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-fs/blob/master/README.md#performance)\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"mafintosh","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},{"name":"maxogden","email":"max@maxogden.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-04-19T13:11:42.644Z","created":"2013-12-20T14:21:12.813Z","0.1.0":"2013-12-20T14:21:12.813Z","0.1.1":"2013-12-20T19:57:40.873Z","0.1.2":"2013-12-20T20:02:53.388Z","0.2.0":"2013-12-21T01:35:45.343Z","0.2.1":"2013-12-21T02:12:01.498Z","0.2.2":"2013-12-23T00:43:45.694Z","0.2.3":"2013-12-23T13:27:25.219Z","0.2.4":"2014-01-06T08:56:28.147Z","0.2.5":"2014-01-13T20:37:59.453Z","0.3.0":"2014-03-24T14:55:20.947Z","0.3.1":"2014-04-02T21:58:45.362Z","0.3.2":"2014-04-03T00:31:00.726Z","0.3.3":"2014-04-11T12:27:14.102Z","0.4.0":"2014-05-30T11:56:59.914Z","0.4.1":"2014-05-30T12:22:45.536Z","0.4.2":"2014-05-30T14:48:16.738Z","0.4.3":"2014-06-27T07:20:13.464Z","0.4.4":"2014-06-30T07:59:17.934Z","0.4.5":"2014-08-19T08:04:24.894Z","0.4.6":"2014-09-23T13:53:58.603Z","0.4.7":"2014-09-23T14:29:44.924Z","1.0.0":"2014-09-24T04:14:50.529Z","1.0.1":"2014-10-23T06:29:12.854Z","1.0.2":"2014-10-23T06:33:10.514Z","1.1.0":"2014-11-18T14:13:21.895Z","1.1.1":"2014-11-18T14:14:58.747Z","1.1.2":"2015-01-07T09:19:42.552Z","1.1.3":"2015-04-07T16:09:41.687Z","1.1.4":"2015-04-18T19:32:23.941Z","1.1.5":"2015-05-15T00:03:55.182Z","1.2.0":"2015-06-16T20:09:29.654Z","1.2.1":"2015-06-21T22:28:14.672Z","1.2.2":"2015-10-15T15:54:00.312Z","1.3.0":"2015-10-28T17:10:59.760Z","1.3.1":"2015-11-06T23:30:43.887Z","1.3.2":"2016-02-17T10:51:31.964Z","1.4.0":"2016-04-04T17:34:55.417Z","1.5.0":"2016-04-05T20:10:25.147Z","1.5.1":"2016-04-06T19:15:30.189Z","1.5.2":"2016-04-19T13:11:42.644Z"},"author":{"name":"Mathias Buus","email":"mathiasbuus@gmail.com"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream.git"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream","keywords":["tar","tarball","parse","parser","generate","generator","stream","stream2","streams","streams2","streaming","pack","extract","modify"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-stream/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"uwo":true,"shanewholloway":true,"sintaxi":true,"fishrock123":true,"timdream":true,"djblue":true,"ahme-t":true,"emilbay":true},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{}}
