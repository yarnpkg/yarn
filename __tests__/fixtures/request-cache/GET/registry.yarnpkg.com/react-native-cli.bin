Running CLI with local modifications\n\nReact Native is distributed as two npm packages, `react-native-cli` and `react-native`. The first one is a lightweight package that should be installed globally (`npm install -g react-native-cli`), while the second one contains the actual React Native framework code and is installed locally into your project when you run `react-native init`.\n\nBecause `react-native init` calls `npm install react-native`, simply linking your local github clone into npm is not enough to test local changes.\n\n### Introducing Sinopia\n\n[Sinopia] is an npm registry that runs on your local machine and allows you to publish packages to it. Everything else is proxied from `npmjs.com`. We'll set up sinopia for React Native CLI development. First, install it with:\n\n    $ npm install -g sinopia\n\nNow you can run sinopia by simply doing:\n\n    $ sinopia\n\nRunning it for the first time creates a default config file. Open `~/.config/sinopia/config.yaml` and configure it like this (note the `max_body_size`):\n\n    storage: ./storage\n\n    auth:\n      htpasswd:\n        file: ./htpasswd\n\n    uplinks:\n      npmjs:\n        url: https://registry.npmjs.org/\n\n    packages:\n      'react-native':\n        allow_access: $all\n        allow_publish: $all\n\n      'react-native-cli':\n        allow_access: $all\n        allow_publish: $all\n\n      '*':\n        allow_access: $all\n        proxy: npmjs\n\n    logs:\n      - {type: stdout, format: pretty, level: http}\n\n    max_body_size: '50mb'\n\nRemember to restart sinopia afterwards.\n\n### Publishing to sinopia\n\nNow we need to publish the two React Native packages to our local registry. To do this, we configure npm to use the new registry, unpublish any existing packages and then publish the new ones:\n\n    react-native$ npm set registry http://localhost:4873/\n    react-native$ npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873/\n    # Check that it worked:\n    react-native$ npm config list\n    react-native$ npm unpublish --force\n    react-native$ npm publish\n    react-native$ cd react-native-cli/\n    react-native-cli$ npm unpublish --force\n    react-native-cli$ npm publish\n\n### Running the local CLI\n\nNow that the packages are installed in sinopia, you can install the new `react-native-cli` package globally and when you use `react-native init`, it will install the new `react-native` package as well:\n\n    $ npm uninstall -g react-native-cli\n    $ npm install -g react-native-cli\n    $ react-native init AwesomeApp\n\n## Testing changes\n\nMost of the CLI code is covered by jest tests, which you can run with:\n\n    $ npm test\n\nProject generation is also covered by e2e tests, which you can run with:\n\n    $ ./scripts/e2e-test.sh\n\nThese tests actually create a very similar setup to what is described above (using sinopia) and they also run iOS-specific tests, so you will need to run this on OSX and have [xctool] installed.\n\nBoth of these types of tests also run on Travis both continuously and on pull requests.\n\n[sinopia]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia\n[xctool]: https://github.com/facebook/xctool\n\n## Clean up\n\nTo unset the npm registry, do:\n\n    $ npm set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/\n    # Check that it worked:\n    $ npm config list\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n##### Sinopia crashes with \"Module version mismatch\"\n\nThis usually happens when you install a package using one version of 
b00
Node and then change to a different version. This can happen when you update Node, or switch to a different version with nvm. Do:\n\n    $ npm uninstall -g sinopia\n    $ npm install -g sinopia\n\nAfter upgrading to Node 4 you might also need to reinstall npm. What worked for me was:\n\n    $ npm uninstall -g npm\n    $ nvm install npm\n\n See the [nvm guide](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) for more info.\n\n### Alternative workflow\n\nIf you don't want to install Sinopia you could still test changes done on the cli by creating a sample project and installing your checkout of `react-native` on that project instead of downloading it from npm. The simplest way to do this is by:\n\n    $ npm init AwesomeProject\n    $ cd AwesomeProject\n    $ npm install $REACT_NATIVE_GITHUB\n\nNote that `REACT_NATIVE_GITHUB` should point to the directory where you have a checkout.\n\nAlso, if the changes you're making get triggered when running `react-native init AwesomeProject` you will want to tweak the global installed `react-native-cli` library to install the local checkout instead of downloading the module from npm. To do so just change this [line](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/react-native-cli/index.js#L191) and refer the local checkout instead.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"amasad","email":"amjad.masad@gmail.com"},{"name":"bestander","email":"bestander@gmail.com"},{"name":"fb","email":"opensource+npm@fb.com"},{"name":"frantic","email":"alex.frantic@gmail.com"},{"name":"mkonicek","email":"martin.konicek@gmail.com"},{"name":"spicyj","email":"ben@benalpert.com"},{"name":"vjeux","email":"vjeuxx@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-06-03T12:32:11.540Z","created":"2015-03-05T22:20:16.014Z","0.0.0":"2015-03-05T22:20:16.014Z","0.0.1":"2015-03-25T22:39:08.628Z","0.1.2":"2015-03-26T19:11:32.733Z","0.1.3":"2015-03-26T19:13:40.504Z","0.1.4":"2015-06-08T21:25:43.359Z","0.1.5":"2015-10-08T21:05:42.002Z","0.1.6":"2015-10-27T23:49:22.649Z","0.1.7":"2015-10-28T01:25:52.984Z","0.1.8":"2016-01-05T17:02:15.220Z","0.1.9":"2016-01-07T17:07:20.169Z","0.1.10":"2016-01-09T15:29:05.669Z","0.2.0":"2016-03-24T17:03:48.048Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-03T12:32:11.540Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","description":"The React Native CLI tools","users":{"markthethomas":true,"season19840122":true,"program247365":true,"despairblue":true,"mjangda":true,"barbarosh":true,"snowdream":true,"rockvic":true,"abdul":true,"konamgil":true,"fedosov":true,"reekdeb":true,"darahak":true,"rorellanam":true,"meshal":true,"bogdanvlviv":true,"floriannagel":true},"homepage":"https://github.com/facebook/react-native#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/facebook/react-native.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues"},"license":"BSD-3-Clause","_attachments":{}}
