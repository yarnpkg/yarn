merge-stream\n\nMerge (interleave) a bunch of streams.\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/grncdr/merge-stream.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/grncdr/merge-stream)\n\n## Synopsis\n\n```javascript\nvar stream1 = new Stream();\nvar stream2 = new Stream();\n\nvar merged = mergeStream(stream1, stream2);\n\nvar stream3 = new Stream();\nmerged.add(stream3);\nmerged.isEmpty();\n//=> false\n```\n\n## Description\n\nThis is adapted from [event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream) separated into a new module, using Streams3.\n\n## API\n\n`merged.add`\n\nA method to dynamically add more sources to the stream.\n\n`merged.isEmpty`\n\nA method that tells you if the merged stream is empty.\n\nWhen a stream is \"empty\" (aka. no sources were added), it could not be returned to a gulp task.\n\nSo, we could do something like this:\n\n```js\nstream = require('merge-stream')();\n// Something like a loop to add some streams to the merge stream\n// stream.add(streamA);\n// stream.add(streamB);\nreturn stream.isEmpty() ? null : stream;\n```\n\n##
