How you do this is up to you. With Babel, use the following plugins:\n\n - es2015-block-scoping\n - object-rest-spread\n - trailing-function-commas\n\nYou will also need to transform or define a global variable named `__DEV__`.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe signature of `cloneReferencedElement` is the same as that of `React.cloneElement`. However, when using callback refs, it will preserve the ref on the original component if there is one.\n\n```js\nlet element =\n  <Component ref={component => {\n    console.log('Running the original ref handler');\n  }} />\ncloneReferencedElement(element, {\n  ref(component) {\n    console.log('Running the clone ref handler');\n  },\n});\n```\n\nWhen the component is mounted, the console will display:\n```\nRunning the clone ref handler\nRunning the original ref handler\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"ide","email":"ide+npm@jameside.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-19T09:40:01.709Z","created":"2016-01-14T05:04:28.233Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-14T05:04:28.233Z","1.0.1":"2016-01-19T09:40:01.709Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ide/react-clone-referenced-element#readme","keywords":["react","clone","element"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/ide/react-clone-referenced-element.git"},"author":{"name":"James Ide"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ide/react-clone-referenced-element/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"brien-crean":true},"_attachments":{}}
