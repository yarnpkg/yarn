Status](https://travis-ci.org/armed/ordered-read-streams.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/armed/ordered-read-streams)\n\nCombines array of streams into one read stream in strict order.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install ordered-read-streams`\n\n## Overview\n\n`ordered-read-streams` handles all data/errors from input streams in parallel, but emits data/errors in strict order in which streams are passed to constructor. This is `objectMode = true` stream.\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nvar through = require('through2');\nvar Ordered = require('ordered-read-streams');\n\nvar s1 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 200)\n});\nvar s2 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 30)\n});\nvar s3 = through.obj(function (data, enc, next) {\n  var self = this;\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    self.push(data);\n    next();\n  }, 100)\n});\n\nvar streams = new Ordered([s1, s2, s3]);\nstreams.on('data', function (data) {\n  console.log(data);\n})\n\ns1.write('stream 1');\ns1.end();\n\ns2.write('stream 2');\ns2.end();\n\ns3.write('stream 3');\ns3.end();\n```\nOuput will be:\n\n```\nstream 1\nstream 2\nstream 3\n```\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"armed","email":"artem.medeusheyev@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-09-13T05:37:22.015Z","created":"2014-01-15T06:50:22.498Z","0.0.1":"2014-01-15T06:50:22.498Z","0.0.2":"2014-01-15T08:37:31.561Z","0.0.3":"2014-01-16T12:32:57.127Z","0.0.4":"2014-01-17T05:03:16.244Z","0.0.5":"2014-01-18T07:16:21.362Z","0.0.6":"2014-01-18T08:06:01.450Z","0.0.7":"2014-01-18T08:32:14.360Z","0.0.8":"2014-07-01T08:20:59.498Z","0.1.0":"2014-09-30T10:02:03.929Z","0.2.0":"2015-03-02T08:34:33.897Z","0.3.0":"2015-07-04T12:40:31.826Z","1.0.0":"2016-09-13T05:37:22.015Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/armed/ordered-read-streams#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/armed/ordered-read-streams.git"},"author":{"name":"Artem Medeusheyev","email":"artem.medeusheyev@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/armed/ordered-read-streams/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"acewinnielee":true},"_attachments":{}}
