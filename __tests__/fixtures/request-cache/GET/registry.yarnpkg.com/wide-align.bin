This is because on a console, all narrow characters are\n// an en wide and all wide characters are an em. In browsers, this isn't\n// held to and wide characters like \"古\" can be less than two narrow\n// characters even with a fixed width font.\n\nconsole.log(align.center('abc', 10))     // '   abc    '\nconsole.log(align.center('古古古', 10))  // '  古古古  '\nconsole.log(align.left('abc', 10))       // 'abc       '\nconsole.log(align.left('古古古', 10))    // '古古古    '\nconsole.log(align.right('abc', 10))      // '       abc'\nconsole.log(align.right('古古古', 10))   // '    古古古'\n```\n\n### Functions\n\n#### `align.center(str, length)` → `str`\n\nReturns *str* with spaces added to both sides such that that it is *length*\nchars long and centered in the spaces.\n\n#### `align.left(str, length)` → `str`\n\nReturns *str* with spaces to the right such that it is *length* chars long.\n\n### `align.right(str, length)` → `str`\n\nReturns *str* with spaces to the left such that it is *length* chars long.\n\n### Origins\n\nThese functions were originally taken from \n[cliui](https://npmjs.com/package/cliui). Changes include switching to the\nMUCH faster pad generation function from\n[lodash](https://npmjs.com/package/lodash), making center alignment pad\nboth sides and adding left alignment.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iarna","email":"me@re-becca.org"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-01-08T21:59:38.349Z","created":"2015-12-16T05:58:03.765Z","1.0.0":"2015-12-16T05:58:03.765Z","1.0.1":"2015-12-16T19:55:49.801Z","1.0.2":"2015-12-31T07:07:16.373Z","1.1.0":"2016-01-08T21:59:38.349Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/iarna/wide-align#readme","keywords":["wide","double","unicode","cjkv","pad","align"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/iarna/wide-align.git"},"author":{"name":"Rebecca Turner","email":"me@re-becca.org","url":"http://re-becca.org/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/iarna/wide-align/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"iarna":true},"_attachments":{}}
