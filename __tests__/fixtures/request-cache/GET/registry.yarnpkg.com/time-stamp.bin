'2015:04:01'\n\ntimestamp('YYYY:MM:DD');\n//=> '2015:04:01'\n\ntimestamp('[YYYY:MM:DD]');\n//=> '[2015:04:01]'\n\ntimestamp('YYYY/MM/DD');\n//=> '2015/04/01'\n\ntimestamp('YYYY:MM');\n//=> '2015:04'\n\ntimestamp('YYYY');\n//=> '2015'\n\ntimestamp('MM');\n//=> '04'\n\ntimestamp('DD');\n//=> '01'\n\ntimestamp('HH');\n//=> '01'\n\ntimestamp('mm');\n//=> '59'\n\ntimestamp('ss');\n//=> '09'\n\ntimestamp('ms');\n//=> '783'\n```\n\n**Valid patterns**\n\n* `YYYY`: full year (ex: **2015**)\n* `MM`: month (ex: **04**)\n* `DD`: day (ex: **01**)\n* `HH`: hours (ex: **12**)\n* `mm`: minutes
