(Note: The spec starts counting at `1`, the returned function at `0`).\n\n__Example:__\n```js\nvar check = nthCheck.compile([2, 3]);\n\ncheck(0) //false\ncheck(1) //false\ncheck(2) //true\ncheck(3) //false\ncheck(4) //true\ncheck(5) //false\ncheck(6) //true\n```\n\n---\nLicense: BSD\n","maintainers":[{"name":"feedic","email":"me@feedic.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-03-12T12:59:56.470Z","created":"2014-02-15T15:06:22.622Z","1.0.0":"2014-02-15T15:06:22.622Z","1.0.1":"2015-03-12T12:59:56.470Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/fb55/nth-check","keywords":["nth-child","nth","css"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/fb55/nth-check"},"author":{"name":"Felix Boehm","email":"me@feedic.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/fb55/nth-check/issues"},"license":"BSD","_attachments":{}}
