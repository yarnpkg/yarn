Thus in\ncontrast to Unix `cp`, the following will fail:\n\n```js\n// dest_dir already exists, and we might expect dest_dir/some_dir to be\n// created. This does not work; pass 'dest_dir/some_dir' instead.\ncopyDereferenceSync('src_dir/some_dir', 'dest_dir');\n```\n\nFile types other than files, directories and symlinks (such as device files or\nsockets) are not supported and will cause an exception.\n\n## Notes\n\n* There intentionally isn't an asynchronous version. It's not clear that we\nneed or want one. Before sending a patch to add an async version, please share\nyour use case on the issue tracker.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"joliss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-07-19T19:24:26.707Z","created":"2014-07-19T19:24:26.707Z","1.0.0":"2014-07-19T19:24:26.707Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/broccolijs/node-copy-dereference","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/broccolijs/node-copy-dereference"},"author":{"name":"Jo Liss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/broccolijs/node-copy-dereference/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
