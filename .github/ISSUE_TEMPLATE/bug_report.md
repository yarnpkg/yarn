<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called "Classic". We released
  Yarn 2 in January 2020, and multiple other minors since then (note that we slightly
  changed how Yarn is installed, hence why `npm install -g yarn` doesn't show 2.x if
  you run `--version`).
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in higher
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the months and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on Yarn 2, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). By contrast, the 2.x line is very
  actively supported. 
  
  Thanks for your understanding!
